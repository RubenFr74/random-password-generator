# Random Password Generator

## About

This is a random password made through JavaScript to help us get familiar with the coding language while also 
making something we can actually use in our lives.
You can also customize what parameters you want for your password through prompts. Like choosing the number of characters the password has to having special characters or not. 

It was pretty challeneging considering this is my first real experience writing in this language so thje code might
be a bit jank.
